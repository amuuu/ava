# Ava Sound Engine
A more complete documentation will be added soon.


## Buid Ava (+ Demo Program)
To build the engine alongside with the demo program you just need to make the project inside the root directory using the command below:
```
make
```

Then you can run the demo program using this command:
```
./demo/AvaDemo
```

If you configure the CMake scripts, make sure to use the command below, to update the auto-generated makefiles (in the root directory). Then build the project using the previous instructions.
```
make --configure .
```
